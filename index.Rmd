# Introduction

## Maximize the return of the portfolio in stock market

### Project outline
As part of our final project, we chose to explore a portfolio of popular securities that is diversified across the different sectors of the S&P 500 and aim to achieve the following:
1. Observe the distribution of our data and apply any necessary transformations in order to simplify our forecast
2. Analyze the portfolio and understand where the most profit stems from. 
3. Explore ways of forecasting individual stocks within the portfolio as well as the return of the entire Portfolio through different methods including factor models, Monte Carlo Simulations, R built in packages, etc
4. Visualize and bound our forecasts within confidence intervals so that we understand what actions to take in the future in order to achieve better results
