Observe the distribution of our data and apply any necessary transformations in order to simplify our forecast 2. Analyze the portfolio and understand where the most profit stems from. 3. Explore ways of forecasting individual stocks within the portfolio as well as the return of the entire Portfolio through different methods including factor models, Monte Carlo Simulations, R built in packages, etc 4. Visualize and bound our forecasts within confidence intervals so that we understand what actions to take in the future in order to achieve better results "],

We are leveraging the tidyquant package for its versatility as we can input a tiemframe and the desired stocks and we get the price data neatly in a tibble. 2.1.2 Kenneth French’s Data library For our factor models we are using data from Kenneth French’s Data library (https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html), where we specifically use factor data for the Market, Size, Value and Momentum factors in order to judge returns for our portfolio of stocks. 2.1.3 Additional data source In addition to the above data, we also create our own data leveraging forecasts achieved through Monte Carlo Simulations and Linear Regressions.

["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Stock data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Stock data transformation Stock Prices are notorious for not following a normal distribution. However, in order to run our analysis and ensure that our results are not biased we need to work with data that is at least fairly normal. In order to ensure this, we will be doing a couple of things: 3.1.1 Increase the sample size We will incease the sample size of our data as we know from the Central Limit Theorem that as we increase the size, our data will start to look approximately normal. Our focus is have sample greater than 1000 (anything above 30 should be normal). 3.1.2 Use log returns As we do know that stock price data tends to be log normally distriuted, we will be using log returns as we know that if we apply a natural logartihm on log-normal data we would be obtaining normally distributed data (All transformations are performed in R). 3.1.3 Filter data into csv files The Factor Data has been filtered to the stipulated time frame and loaded from a CSV file. No other changes have been made to it. "],
